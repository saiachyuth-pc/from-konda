My Favorite song is "Pranamam ", It was Composed by Famous Musician Devi Sri Prasad.

"Pranamam" is a popular Telugu song from the 2016 movie "Janatha Garage." Composed by Devi Sri Prasad and sung by Shankar Mahadevan, the song expresses gratitude and reverence. The lyrics by Ramajogayya Sastry add depth, and the song received positive reviews for its emotive rendition and picturesque picturization in the film. It contributed to the overall success of the movie's soundtrack and remains a favorite among music lovers.
